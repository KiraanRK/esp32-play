# Play!

Making games should be fun, approachable, and accessible to people of all ages.

The Play! project is a tiny video game development console, with a 2d game engine, sprite editor, level editor, and game logic editor.

Based on off-the-shelf hardware (and maybe eventually in kit form), kids (and adults) can piece together their own video game console, learn how to program, and learn about electronics while having fun creating games.


## Building

My directory structure is as follows:

```
~/
  dev/
     play/
  extra_components/
     esp32-lua-rtos
     ...

```

See `setenv.sh`.

Maybe git submodules would be a better solution, but this way allows me to share components across my esp32 projects.
